# JQuery-Practice
Assignment "jQuery DOM Practice" for UMass/Springboard bootcamp

<h2>Part One</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll write some jQuery statements to perform some DOM manipulation</p>

<h2>Complete the following steps in the following file:</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When the DOM is ready, console.log the message “Let’s get ready to party with jQuery!”</li>
<li>Give all images inside of an article tag the class of image-center (this class is defined inside of the style tag in the head).</li>
<li>Remove the last paragraph in the article.</li>
<li>Set the font size of the title to be a random pixel size from 0 to 100.</li>
<li>Add an item to the list; it can say whatever you want.</li>
<li>Scratch that; the list is silly. Empty the aside and put a paragraph in it apologizing for the list’s existence.</li>
<li>When you change the numbers in the three inputs on the bottom, the background color of the body should change to match whatever the three values in the inputs are.</li>
<li>Add an event listener so that when you click on the image, it is removed from the DOM.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="part-two-movies-app">
<h2>Part Two - Movies App!</h2>
<p>Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Contains a form with two inputs for a title and rating along with a button to submit the form.</li>
<li>When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.</li>
<li>When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="further-study">
<h2>Further Study</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ensure that the rating of a movie can only be between 0 and 10.</li>
<li>Ensure that a title has at least 2 characters in it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
